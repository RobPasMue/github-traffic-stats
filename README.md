# github-traffic-stats

Get statistics on web traffic to your GitHub repositories.

## Python CLI

Python CLI tool to get web traffic stats on the command line using the GitHub API.

A few use cases to show why this may be useful.

- Checking the volume of traffic to all of your repos. Monitor sudden spikes in interest or any general patterns.
- Storing the traffic stats for future reference.

### Dependencies

- Requests ([kennethreitz/requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests))

There are a number of GitHub [libraries](https://developer.github.com/libraries/) for Python and other languages, although they may not support the Repository Traffic API (announced on August 15, 2016).

### Run

```
$ python github-traffic-stats.py 'nchah' 'github-traffic-stats' 'save_csv'

# Or to get stats on all of your repositories

```

Traffic data stored in CSV files with columns:
```
repository_name, date, views, unique_visitors
```

Separate CSVs are created for each run of the script.
To merge and only preserve the unique data points, run:

```
$ bash bash/merge-csv.sh [folder_with_CSVs]
```
